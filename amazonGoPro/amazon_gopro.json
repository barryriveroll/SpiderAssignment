Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).</span>"},

Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera.</span>"},

The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.<br>I have never owned any GoPro before, I always preferred Sony action cams more.  I have to say this one is an excellent camera for 360 VR work.<br>This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.  Image wise, this one looks nice.</span>"},

{"id": "R3HUHSB4E4ETX0", "title": "Great camera, easy to film with, not too hard to edit for the intermediate premiere user.", "date": "April 26, 2018", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "text": "<span class=\"\">I had little trouble getting started with this camera. It appears as though GoPro has fixed their bugs at initial launch with some firmware patches.<br><br>I think there is little understanding or documentation on how to use and edit these kinds of cameras, but if you have experience with stitching panoramas or editing in Adobe Premiere or Photoshop, you should be able to figure out how to use this camera within a few hours. Editing in 360 as well as their overcapture/reframe mode take about the same skill level.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-The stitching in the software is almost always on point, there will always be imperfections, but for the most part, stitching at eye level viewing angles is consistent.<br>-Multi axis stabilization (software based stabilization) is very impressive, and holds the camera angle in place (in my case I've noticed by default it points north at the horizon, regardless of  how you physically move the camera) which makes for great footage from a moving vehicle going over rough terrain (emulates human head movement) or while walking and unintentionally twisting/tilting camera. In low light you do get some strange blurring, so I cannot always recommend using it, but you can choose whether you need it after recording your video.<br>-Battery life is good; usually doesn't run out of battery during a day's worth of casual use. Probably had the battery run down over an 8 hour period with about an hour's worth of clips taken<br>-stitching software offers a lot of export modes, camera raw adjustments (for both video and photo)<br>-voice recognition is pretty accurate, does not get a lot of false positives. Of course your friends will want to talk over you when you try to use voice commands<br>-type C charging<br>-editing in premiere with the provided plugins is surprisingly easy if you are experienced with premiere, not too difficult to learn if you are new to premiere. If you don't know how to edit in premiere, I think gopro's quik works with this camera, but I haven't tested it.<br>-App works well (android) to preview shots in 360, and play back files from the camera before rendering. Its a little slow and sometimes a pain to connect to, but overall very usable.<br><br>Cons<br>-wake time is slow, takes about 10-15 seconds to start up, so it is not super convenient for the unexpected, but when it is powered on, it will start recording immediately<br>-Price point is a bit steep. I'd say I got my money's worth, but for some, the price is steep<br>-requires a lot of hard drive space on your computer, I would recommend having about 4 TB available to sandbox around with this camera. Premiere will need more swap disk space than normal<br>-need a newer computer to edit video, especially when using the reframe function. Don't expect your 6 or 7 year old computer to play nicely with this camera. It kind of works on my 7 year old desktop, but I get a lot of errors in Premiere. Works flawlessly on my new laptop.<br>-about every minute of raw footage is about 1 GB of video files before stitching, files get bigger after stitching.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>If you are in the market for a 360 camera, and don't have a serious budget constraint, I would pick this camera, as it is made and supported by an American company. There are some great low budget cameras that have similar specs on the market, but they are from relatively new Chinese companies, so I don't know if I trust them to support the camera long term, even though gopro has been struggling themselves.</span>"},

{"id": "R2OHTZ3ZMAO4GX", "title": "Very good image quality, awful to use, terrible software, garbage tripod", "date": "September 1, 2018", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "text": "<span class=\"\">I wanted a 360 camera for when taking vacations to capture spherical photos and videos of my travels for use in my VR headsets. I looked at reviews and samples and wanted the highest possible image quality without getting in to professional costs, which lead me to the GoPro. It lives up to the hype on image quality, and the stabilization is awesome. That is unfortunately where the good note ends.<br><br>The companion Android app is terrible, it's an awful UI, it's laggy, unresponsive, constantly losing wireless connection to the camera. It crashes often, can't export images out of the app to make available to the rest of the phone, frequently the live video feed would disappear. It's basically unusable, and since the camera doesn't have a reasonable self timer, there is no other good way to trigger the shutter without holding the camera with my face blocking half of the field of view, without of course buying another wireless remote that probably won't work well.<br><br>The Fusion Studio application for stitching photos and videos together just straight up doesn't run on half of my computers, and the other half it runs poorly. It tends to hang, it comes with no useful documentation, you just kind of muddle through it blindly. The video encoder settings are limited to three codecs, two of which are not commonly useful for consumption by VR devices, and the third one limits the resolution for no reason. You can invoke the encoder from the command line and generate videos at the full 5.2k resolution no problem, and they look great, if it happens to run and finish and not crash that is. This is also not documented of course, I had to figure it out for myself.<br><br>Finally, the included Fusion stick/tripod (which you must use because it doesn't have a standard tripod mount, unless you once again spend more money) broke on me the third time I tried to use it, the telescoping mechanism jammed and when I tried to unjam it, it just broke in half. Turns out the rugged GoPro product is held together by cheap glue and sloppy tolerance plastic shims. So, this is of course going straight back to Amazon.<br><br>I'm frankly very disappointed in GoPro, this offering is expensive and has the quality of a McDonalds happy meal toy.</span>"},

It was a few hundred dollars more than the Rylo, but the Rylo was a disaster.<br><br>Purchased this camera in efforts to record kids basketball games without having to Pan the camera back and forth.  The Overcapture feature was the winning feature on this camera along with the 5.2k resolution (so you can zoom and overcapture) which pushed me to give this camera a try.<br><br>Pros:<br>-GoPro built<br>-less buggy than the Rylo<br>-the remote interface on the phone to control the camera is great, but it's very buggy<br>-although i didn't use it, the included selfie stick is awesome<br>-the stitching is awesome, easy and brainless (no small feat)<br><br>Cons:<br>-The remote interface is buggy.<br>-128GB (64G x2) will only give you about 2h40min of recording time at 3k resolution<br>-most importantly.... the 5.2k just isn't enough.  Once my basketball videos were taken and editing or watching with the overcapture feature at 5.2k, the players were completely undiscernable and fuzzy.  Not a problem using a GoPro 5 Blk at 720 or 1080p.<br>-chomps through the battery in a short time, better to use an external battery for long planned recordings<br><br>Here it is.  If you want a camera to record your self going down the slopes, riding a wave, skateboarding or whatnot but don't plan to zoom in and don't mind the reduced resolution (5.2k is a lot, but not considering when you think it covers ALL 360 degrees at ALL elevations) - this is your camera.  It's better than the competition.<br><br>The remote software on the iPhone IS buggy.  constantly crashes and you have to exit it and start over again to gain control of the camera.  Loses the camera's wifi from time to time despite being within 5 feet of it.  The remote viewing konks out from time to time as well - again fixed by exiting and restarting.  This will probably get fixed with firmware/app updates.<br><br>Again, I'm recording basketball games from the sideline.  Zooming in to capture 1/2 of the court does make the video very very fuzzy as 5.2k just isn't enough.  Remember, it's 5.2k all 360 degrees and then UP and Down.  Therefore even a 2k, 720 etc is far more resolution for the framed screen than this one.<br><br>Three stars to GoPro for this effort.  I get it.... it's hard.  5.2k is a lot to record and the file sizes get huge.  They did an amazing effort on the easy to do stitching.  The firmware/software is buggy at best.  They easily beat the current competition.  However at $800 this is not the camera to record sports for watching afterwards if you need greater or equal resolution to your current GoPro.<br><br>After trying three 360 degree cameras, I've come to the conclusion that NO current 360 setup is technologically here yet.  The professional VR rigs you can buy for $10k and require lots of editing and stitching will do it, but for a consumer, it's just not here and technological hurdles still need to be solved/invented.</span>"},

How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked \"Helpful\" when they are \"rah rah\"...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.

You can shoot 360 degree video, you can do all sorts of things with this amazing camera it seems, however (and this is a big however) if you own an Android device, congratulations, you've just bought a very expensive door stop.<br>There is very very limited support for Android devices at the moment, in fact this isn't supported at all on the Galaxy S5, my cheapo Chinese Android tablet, my galaxy S8+  nor is it supported on my Galaxy Tab 3.  The only android device I can get it to work with is a Galaxy S7.  Even then, the most you can do is download short 30 second video clips.  You cannot even download or edit any of the video or photos it takes with your android device.  However, don't worry, as according to gopro, you can use the desktop PC app \"Fusion Studio\" to retrieve and edit your footage.  Great for all of those on the go people who want to take photo's or shoot short video's, just bring your entire desktop PC with you...  However that Laptop or PC better be running Windows 10, it better have 8GB of ram because if not, even the GoPro fusion studio itself won't work.  Seriously, until this device gets full Android support, I would honestly skip on buying it for now.  There are cheaper and more compatible options out there.<br><br>**updated 6/26/2018**<br>Finally some updates worth talking about.  Android does have some support at this time, however the app is a bit strange to deal with.  You first of all have to download the 360 footage to your phone via the app (and you can only download it directly to the phone and not the SD card, this means that you're limited to about a 33 second clip).  You then have to exit out of the camera on the app, go into the splash screen, select \"media\", select the \"local\" tab and then edit your footage from there.  You can take a screen shot (photo) and re-frame it, then upload to facebook or instagram.  You can also do the same with 33 seconds of 360 footage.  You basically record the angle you want, but while recording you can pinch to zoom in or out or you can turn your phone around in your hands in the internal gyroscope will track your movement.  This however can lead to slightly jerky looking footage, you may want to sit yourself in an office chair and spin around slowly for a panning effect.  On one hand the inability to do smooth pans via the app is bad, on the other hand, who ever thought you could use an office chair as a video editing tool?  That's actually kinda fun.  The main problem though is the lack of video stabilization, you only get that by using Fusion Studio on your PC.  You also can't put any graphs on your footage (info taken from the GPS) unless your run it through the Fusion Studio either.<br><br>I raised my review by one star for finally getting some android support, but I still think this camera is too big, too square and lacking in proper hardware based solutions to be a true 360 breakthrough camera.  I hope that if GoPro do another version, they address these issues and improve the usability of their app.<br><br>UPDATED: 8/31/2018:<br><br>So I've updated my review after owning this camera for quite a while and now I have to say, it's my favorite gopro to shoot video with.  I find that the ability to reframe shots after you've recorded them to be immense fun as well as hugely practical.  It's like having multiple cameras set up for a shoot.  However the problem with this camera is that you'll get back exactly what you put into it.  If you just buy the camera and only expect to use your android device to edit video with, then you're going to end up with shakey video, poor pans and the ability to only export 33 seconds at a time.  To get better use out of the camera, you're going to have to get either a PC or Laptop with some very decent specs and use the Go Pro Fusion Studio software.  That  gives you full camera stabilization (which borders on supernatural at times it can be so smooth) but you're looking at quite a cost (I spent about $1300 on my setup).  However, the fusion software only lets you export a static view (so no active panning or zooming shots).  Which means to get full use out of the software and footage, you're going to have to export your footage as a 360 degree video and then import it into something like Adobe Premier Pro (which will cost you about $25 per month for a license).  Only then will you be able to make the stunning video's you want.  So shooting in 360 gets awfully expensive fast............... and yet...  I'm finding it's worth it.  Not only is the video footage stunning but the options for your finished product are endless.  Although I love the image quality produced by the GoPro Hero 6, it's the ability to reframe, pan and zoom in post production that makes the GoPro fusion really stand out.  I wasn't impressed when I first got it, but now that I've owned it for a while, I'm loving what I can do with this camera and what lies down the road for me.  It may not be 5 stars due to the costs involved, but it's a very well earned 4 stars.<br>Updated 3/5/2019:<br>So after owning this camera for quite some time, I'm finally updating my review to finalize it at 4 stars.<br>Pro's:<br>Can shoot some stunning video<br>You realize just how versatile a 360 degree camera is when it comes to editing and reframing shots.<br>It's hard not to be impressed when you see your final footage.<br>Your footage put's other (non Fusion) action cam shots to shame!<br>New updated Firmware brings 5.6K resolution at 24FPS<br>I love video editing and this camera makes it fun!<br><br>Cons:<br>PC software can experience random crashes with some clips (GoPro Fusion Studio 1.4).<br>Android software needs updating (last Jan 2019 update actually had a fault that resulted in me being unable to download photo's or video to my phone, had to revert to December 2018 version of app).<br>You really do need the hardware (PC) to render footage which can be expensive and a subscription to Adobe Premier to get full editing capabilities (active pans and zooms with keyframes as opposed to static camera angles).<br>You need yet another separate 3rd party software package to pull GPS data from the camera.<br><br>At the end of the day, this camera isn't really suited to those who want to spend a minimum amount of time making \"point and shoot\" clips.  However for those willing to invest the time, energy and money into producing stunning footage, then you can't go wrong with this camera.  GoPro need to throw their resources into providing stable easy to use software that takes full advantage of the Fusions capabilities as this is where most of the flaws and bad user experiences stem from.  If they did that, then they'd easily have a 5 star product that anyone could use.  Until then, this camera earns itself a solid four star rating.</span>"},

The photos taken by Fusion are amazing but almost equally are good are the frame grab photos you can get from videos.<br><br>As far as usability, this is a camera that is taking 5.2K resolution video so if you don't have a computer capable of handling 4K editing, you won't really be able to get the most from this camera.

I had to download the PDF user manual and even after referencing it several times, I still feel like I'm struggling to 'get it'.  That's me I guess, and I am committed to getting better and knowing more.<br><br>However, I don't think the Fusion is for those who are not willing to put in the time to learn how to use it. It's not a simple point and shoot, and unfortunately, the software needed to fine tune it isn't really as good as it should be.<br><br>Fusion Studio software looks like it's ready to go, but when the video is uploaded it becomes glitchy and tough to use.  I've tried the software on a Mac running the latest macOS and on a Windows 10 PC.  Both have core i7 processors and ample memory, so I thought I'd be OK.  Windows does better than the Mac for me, yet it all still feels uncomfortable and harder than it should be.  Disappointing, but I'm crossing my fingers for updates to this software that will make things smoother with time.<br><br>I struggled to get my Fusion to upload video and stills to my iPhone's GoPro app.  The app had recognized the camera and connected via Bluetooth without an issue.  Preview windows of the video and stills showed up as blanks with exclamation points inside them, but no photos or videos appeared.  I could not view them, nor could I upload them to save.<br><br>I was able to connect my Fusion camera to both the PC and Mac directly and upload that way.  Something I was trying to avoid as it's generally so much simpler to do it wirelessly.<br><br>The build quality of the Fusion camera seems on par with the other GoPro cameras.  It has voice activated commands which make it much easier to use than those which do not.  Its ability to shoot video in 5K 360 is amazing, but you have to have powerful, user-friendly software to tweak footage and so far, that's not part of the package.<br><br>To be fair there are other programs that can manipulate the GoPro Fusion's output files, but for the price point, that shouldn't be a requirement for enjoyment of this cam.<br><br>To date, I've yet to really be able to fully enjoy this camera due to app and software issues.

My biggest issue is that the desktop app does not allow for key framing of the over capture files. That is to say when you convert a 360 video to a regular video you can only re-frame in one static direction. If the subject of the video moves in relation to the initial direction you have directed the overcapture then you are stuck.  For me this is a major shortcoming. I am fine with long transfer and render times if the output is good (which it is). However, if you can not create the cool panning effects or in and out of the 'small planet view' then what is the point of shooting 360? Insta360 and Rylo apps both support this feature in the free editing app. I realize there are plugins for Adobe Premiere that allow this, but this is not a solution for those of us with investments in other editors.</span>"},

It delivers 360-degree videos with stunning detail and clarity. Still images don\u2019t have quite the crispness of video, but are still \u201cwow\u201d quality.<br><br> But working with the GoPro Fusion is not going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.

A lot of what you\u2019ll find on the web about GoPro Fusion Studio is outdated, third-hand, inaccurate and often just plain wrong.<br><br> It took me a little experimentation to learn the ins-and-outs of Fusion Studio and I don\u2019t consider myself a pro yet.<br><br> Render times are long. The attitude I\u2019ve adopted is to load my footage, start the rendering process and walk away for as long as it takes, which may be many, many hours, depending on how much  you\u2019re rendering. I haven\u2019t been bothered with crashes \u2013 so far.<br><br> The results are stunning. Generally, stitch lines are difficult to find. If you\u2019re filming people, make sure to orient the lenses so the split line doesn\u2019t cross their faces.<br><br> GoPro includes plug-ins for use with Adobe Premiere and AfterEffects \u2013 and virtually no documentation on how to use them. If you don\u2019t already know Premiere, you\u2019re going to have to learn a little more than the absolute basics. It\u2019s worth the effort, though, because you can then make full use of the GoPro OverCapture feature which essentially allows the Fusion to act as if it were multiple cameras.<br><br> Once your Fusion footage been rendered, you can use other programs for editing, such as those intended for Insta360 or Garmin VIRB.<br><br> In the end, all the learning, all the work, is worth it for the results you can achieve. I consider myself a beginner and I am still learning, but I am turning out what I think are awesome results.<br><br> Consider that the GoPro Fusion is a every expensive 360-degree camera. On top of that, you have to buy two high-quality and expensive microSD cards. And you need to have access to or own Adobe Premier or AfterEffects. Then you have to spend a lot of time learning how to use the Fusion camera, the Fusion Studio software and the Adobe program plug-ins.<br><br> Is it worth it? I don\u2019t think everyone will think so.<br><br> But for those willing to make the effort and spend the money, the results will be outstanding.<br><br>Jerry</span>"},

Unlike a normal single field-of-vision video or photo camera the image is a spherical/fish-eye virtual reality (VR) 360 degree view, so nothing is missed. But, if the intension is to share anything but VR, the output needs to be precisely edited to make useable.  Operating this camera entails a number of software programs and an app as well downloading and installing files, etc. This is not a plug and play device.<br><br>The software both inside the camera and for the PC/Mac needs to evolve particularly in the ease of use area which is why the review is four and not five stars. And, even being reasonably comfortable with computer software, and somewhat (amateur-level) experienced with single perspective editing, the re-framing and rendering for the camera is different and requires commitment, practice and a powerful computer with plenty of memory.<br><br>I used the camera with a current iOS 11.4 device (iPhone) and had no issues with the mobile app. The first step is loading the app from the Apple App store. The correct one is named--GoPro formerly Capture. An account must be established with GoPro that consists of simply an email address and password.<br><br>If interested in additional setup details and issues encountered they are included further down in the review. Note that the information included with the device is minimal but a 70 plus page Manual is on the website in the Support area and it provides detail on a wide range of information even explaining how to hold the camera if not using a stand or mount.<br><br>The camera has two lenses facing in opposite directions, slightly offset, each capturing a spherical field of vision (FOV) image. It can be used for regular and slow motion videos along with still and time-lapse photography. Various settings are possible using the 3/4 inch square LED screen on the camera by cycling through the options with the mode and shutter buttons. The beauty of shooting 350 degrees, particularly in an action sequence is a view finder isn\u2019t a necessity because everything is being captured.<br><br>Most of the settings are also available on a connected Apple or Android mobile device. Some functions are also accessible with voice commands, such as--GoPro Start Video and GoPro Stop Video, etc. Utilizing the voice option can inadvertently stop and start recording if the name is said within ear-shot of the device so there are times it may be best disabled.<br><br>It requires two not-included microSD cards. I used two 32GB SanDisk Ultras one each for the front and back lenses so when a picture or video is captured there is one 180 degree image on each card. The free GoPro software on the website for either mobile, PC or Mac stitches the two together for a 360 degree image.<br><br>A connected mobile device can be used to control the camera for capturing videos or photos and viewing them using the free GoPro app. The mobile device software on the website also provides some limited editing and file sharing capabilities.<br><br>The PC or Mac software offers the most comprehensive options so Images from the device can be copied, viewed and edited. From the official home site, I downloaded free Fusion Studio 1.2.1.400, VR Player 3.0.5, and Quik 2.6.1.780.<br><br>Captured files can be viewed or edited on a PC or Mac, either directly from the camera connected to a USB port, or copied by taking the microSD cards out of the camera and copying them to the computer\u2019s hard drive.<br><br>I plugged the camera into a Dell Laptop running the latest version of Windows 10. Two drives appeared in the list of storage devices--Fusion Front and Fusion Back. All file names consist of a sequential four digit number preceded by \u201cGPFR\u201d or \u201cGPBK\u201d for the front and back images respectively. Photos are stored as \u201cjpg\u201d files and videos are \u201cmp4\u201d files.<br><br>The Studio software requires 8 GB of available memory in Windows, and although I have that installed on my laptop it displayed a message saying there was not enough memory to run the program. A button with the message--Return to Fusion appeared and when clicked the program seemed to work anyway, presenting the choice to load from the attached camera or to find the files on the disk.<br><br>Editing video was very slow and choppy directly from the camera, so I copied the files to the PC hard drive by inserting the microSD cards into the computer\u2019s card reader. The program warned me once again that there was not enough memory, but continued to work.<br><br>The editing was a bit faster and less choppy, but the software crashed a few times and had to be re-started--certainly not optimal. Later, I tried again on a desktop Windows 10 computer with 16 GB of memory, and the editing was much smoother, faster and did not crash.<br><br>This is a complex device and requires dedication to master. With the Studio software, the spherical photo or video can be turned into something that looks like it was shot from a regular digital camera. This I relatively amazing because when you are capturing the image, the camera does not have to be pointed at anything in particular. It records everything above, below, in front or behind.<br><br>Using the software, with the tools included, it can be re-framed with OverCapture, stabilized, stitched, rendered, and colored so the final product can be a still or a video that includes things you didn\u2019t even know you were recording.

Initially when the app started it connected to the camera and indicated there was a software update but in spite of repeated attempts it just wouldn\u2019t load. I checked the website\u2019s support area and browsed the detailed User Guide and found how to load the update manually. After following the steps and re-starting the app and completing the connection sequence the camera worked immediately.<br><br>Included is small visual guide that details things like inserting and charging the rechargeable battery (included) and where to insert two micro SD cards (not included). The brochure shows how to attach the mounts or if not needed, completely remove the reciprocal portion attached to the camera. I next charged the battery with the included USB-C to USB-A cable. Cable length is approximately 18 inches.<br><br>Battery charging takes approximately two hours. I noticed while charging the camera gets warm and during operation depending upon length of usage it can get hot. When not recording, the camera automatically turns off after 7 minutes.<br><br>When recording a video the camera automatically saves the files in segments called chapters. These files are created every 5 minutes and each is approximately 4 GB. There is no way to alter chapter size but when played back directly from the camera the video appears seamless. When put together with editing software it also plays as one continuous video.<br><br>The device is stated to be waterproof up to 16 feet. A tripod is also included along with three camera mounts to position the device either on a flat surface, a slightly concave or tripod.

I've had the Fusion since last November and use it professionally as I do 360 work for Google Street View and for clients as well.<br><br>Pros:<br>Great battery life. I can often go on a trip and shoot hundreds of photos as well as a lot of video without recharging.<br>Wonderful outdoor photo quality. I find that my shots done in full daylight are incredibly crisp and clear, with excellent color matching.<br><br>Cons:<br>Stupid button placement.

The apps. I use both the iOS app -- which isn't too bad and quite handy for taking tripod shots via Wi-Fi when you're hiding out of the way -- and the Mac app. The Mac app is set up to launch when the Fusion is attached, and it NEVER works. Even when the app is launched, it doesn't see the camera. What I end up doing is removing the twin micro-SD cards, reading them to a directory on the Mac, then forcing the app to look at that directory for stitching. Even on a fairly fast iMac, stitching is slow for photos and dreadfully slow for video.<br><br>My biggest complaint is the color quality when taking photos indoors. Sure, I can often clear up the odd hues in post-processing, but I'm looking for a much faster workflow and don't want to spend the extra time doing color adjustment.<br><br>If you're going to shoot outdoors exclusively, then by all means get the Fusion -- it excels on shooting photos and video outdoors. Just be aware that you're probably going to be frustrated with both the mobile and desktop apps. For indoor work, try something else because you'll be disappointed with the quality you get. This was my first GoPro product and will definitely be my last.</span>"},

This camera has been way more trouble than it's worth. I bought a new computer to handle the bloated software, but the Fusion software doesn't work correctly to import images directly from the camera on Mojave OS 10.14.2.

The photos and videos I could take with the Fusion are simply incredible - the fish eye and little planet videos look simply cool and the 360 photos/videos let you feel you're back on vacation even weeks after you're back home. The Fusion will from now on go on every trip with me! My only wish for the future, please make the GoPro apps and FusionStudio better (much better ;))</span>"},

Sure, if you already have an expensive smartphone you can connect to the GoPro fusion via the app and get some usability, but this approach has limitations with respect to stitching the image together into one, clear, spherical image. Where the GoPro Fusion really shines is when the images are processed on a desktop computer, the image is beautiful as if you are looking through a literal \"eye in the sky\". The one caveat (and it's a big one) is your desktop computer must be an absolute BEAST of a machine in order to process the footage in any reasonable amount of time, if at all before the RAM is exceeded and you have to give up hours later. To put this in perspective, you will probably need a video-processing desktop currently priced at $2K-$3K+. I have been successful at making clips up to 5 minutes long work on my computer with 8GB RAM and 2G DDR5 GPU, however, that is only after I had to tune down the resolution to 2K, and the stitching process still took over an hour. On the back end, the stitched videos are not compatible with past versions of the GoPro Studio software, which is a remarkably good and intuitive means of video editing (GoPro why did you move away from this?). As an alternative, GoPro opted to offer a GoPro Fusion toolbox for an Adobe video-editing software, which is only available via a subscription basis, minimum $20 per month with no option to straight-up purchase. At face value, this is an excellent option for a professional in the video-editing field, but I have neither the patience nor the presence to justify changing what has already worked in the past for me. I gave Adobe an honest attempt, but perhaps my computer was not up to par, nothing seemed to work.<br><br>For me, as someone that works for a living and casually makes films of my adventures for Youtube that purchased the GoPro Fusion without buying the additional multi-thousand dollar desktop and has a dislike for a lack of options when I am required to go through a third-party software, I am limited to producing 5 minute long, RAW clips with no edits, to Youtube in 2K format. Right here right now this camera is a novelty with the ability to fire on all cylinders and blow away competitors IF you have deep pockets. What I would like to see is for GoPro to bring Fusion support to their now-unsupported GoPro Studio Desktop software similar to the software that Garmin developed for their 360 camera, very slick. Of course, this could all be corrected as well if GoPro redesigned the smartphone apps to be compatible with Fusion 360 footage so I can make actual 360 movies (not just Overcapture clips, 360 has more replay value to audience), improve stitching on the smartphone, and ensure the stitching process on smartphone doesn't crash once it reaches 100% (for no reason). I have hope GoPro can pull this off on the software side of the house, the problem does not seem to exist with the camera itself........except for ONE thing.......the fisheye lenses work great until you want to use them as literal fish eyes under the water, then the diffraction of the water will ensure that you lose approximately 40 degrees from your field of view, IMPOSSIBLE to create a spherical image, even in the clamshell housing that's available on Amazon for about $50. Fortunately that housing necessarily protects the lenses since there is now way you can drop this camera WITHOUT it landing directly on a lens and scratching it, the problem is that the fish-eye is so extreme the camera is actually looking bat at itself, which distorts the final image. To resolve this you should be able to sandwich two acrylic domes &gt;4inch diameter around the camera which will minimize distortion.<br><br>I bought it, I'm moderately happy, will be significantly more happy as I do my custom hardware fixes and GoPro does necessary software updates.</span>"},

Let's start there. The stitching is really, really good as well. However.....software. This is a camera without a viewfinder or screen of any kind, so the only way you can tweak settings or actually SEE what you are shooting is by linking it to a phone or tablet. That's where this review lost three stars. Both the phone app and the software are MAJOR Cons that anyone purchasing this product needs to be aware of.<br><br>PROS: Image quality is excellent. Videos, while not absolutely perfect at the seems, is still handled better than most other cameras in this price range. It does everything the Gopro Hero 6 can do, except in 3D<br><br>CONS: There is ZERO protection for the lenses. If you drop it or bump it while you are shooting and scratch or crack a lens, your goose is cooked. GoPro has no option to replace the lens. SO BUY THAT ACCIDENT PROTECTION!!!! This is one area where the VIRB 360 from Garmin beats the pants off gopro. They are targeting the action cam market. How can you offer no protection for the lens given the kinds of things your target audience wants to use it for???<br><br>The phone app is horrendous. If you are on Iphone you will have a better experience than android, but just barely. Features crash constantly. If you are on android, you better hope you have one of ten SPECIFIC MODEL #'s of phone. Otherwise you can't pair your fusion to your phone at all. No matter how new or powerful your device is. That's something you won't see mentioned on the box or in the user guide. Android support is abysmal.<br><br>The desktop software is improving, but still a headache. There is no getting around it. You MUST use Gopro Fusion studio to stitch your images. And that process takes a LOOOOOONNNNGGGGG time. It's also prone to crashing a lot. They recently added support to the app for the cameras HDR functions, kind of. If you click on that menu option it just gives you instructions on using third party software. It's a workaround more than a feature.<br><br>Long story short, GoPro forced this one out too quickly and rather than catching up and making this thing worth the price we paid, they are basically just cruising till their next 360 cam comes out. If they don't fix the crippling problems with the android app, this will be the last GoPro product I ever buy.</span>"},
{"id": "R3HYT3WIQL3964", "title": "Fantastic 360 camera, with some glaring flaws", "date": "June 5, 2019", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "text": "<span class=\"\">This is a great camera.  The video it takes looks amazing, better than anything else I've seen in the price range.  The pictures are great too.  It really adds an extra level to your vacation pics and vids when you can look around 360 degrees. I looked at a few alternatives, and the Fusion just had the best, natural looking videos, with the best color.  The app and desktop software is where it really falls off.  The app isn't fully functional on Samsung phones for some reason (only the world's largest phone manufacturer, that's all). You can't share videos from the phone.  The desktop software requires a really high-end CPU and a decent video card, and it's still very slow to render.  While on vacation I was able to render 360 pics on a cousins cheap laptop, but had to wait until I got home to render 360 video.<br><br>Another issue is with the desktop app crashing all the time.  I have a high-end computer, i7-6700k 24GB RAM RTX 2080, and whenever I would render 5.2k or 5.6k videos, the app would start to consume all of my memory and then crash.  I read that turning-off 360 audio could fix it, but I want 360 audio, so I found this workaround.  In Windows 10, go to task manager, and the 'Details' tab.  Find the Fusion Studio app, right-click, select 'Set Affinity'.  You need to limit the number of corse the Fusion Studio app has access to.  You can play around with it to find the right mix, but I've found limiting it to Core 1, 2, and 3 works every time, but makes the rendering process even slower!<br><br>Watching video is another issue.  My 5k video uploaded to Youtube seems to work fine everywhere.  I have an Oculus GO which couldn't handle the 5k video from the Fusion (very slow and choppy). The GO works with 4k exported video, but it looses some detail. My hi-res pictures worked fine on everything.<br><br>The GoPro plus service works for this camera, but unfortunately they won't let you upload video to the cloud, which kills it IMO.  So basically all you get is the camera replacement service, for $5/month, plus you have to pay a deductible should you need a replacement.  Plus 50% off accessories, but it seems to me like the Gopro website has accessories twice the price as amazon anyways, so it's a wash.  Kind of a waste in my opinion, get the damage protection plan instead from the retailer.<br><br>Overall, if you have a good computer, and you're willing to tinker around and figure out how to make this thing work, it's a great camera and takes amazing-looking videos.</span>"},

It runs more slowly on smaller devices but runs very well on my higher processor desktop.  Everything else pales in comparison to the 360 if you take into consideration the 3D nature of the videos.  The video quality will catch up eventually, given the new software in beta.  I am very much looking forward to these improvements and remain a hardcore avid customer/fan of GoPro.
